In Assignment 5 we have two codes :

(1)Create a Dictionary of Student Marks: in this code we have a dictionary (student) and in it we have data of students name and marks. and we also used loops in it.
so when we run this code then the code will ask for the name of the student as input, if the name is present in the dictionary then it will print the name and the marks of the student and
if the name is not present in the dictionari then it will  print that student not found.

(2) Demonstrate List Slicing : in this code we have a list , by string slicing we get a list of the first five element of the list and again we have used string slicing[::-1] and this will 
give the reverse of the string.
